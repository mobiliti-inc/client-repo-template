## 💨 Running the Project

### Using a Script

```bash
sh ./setup.sh
```

### Manually

**Install the packages**

`npm install` or `yarn install`

**Start the application**

`npm start` or `yarn start`

When the app is run in development mode. Open <http://0.0.0.0:80> to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

### Building the app

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

`npm run build` or `yarn build`

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed after a build!

## ⚖️ JS/React Testing

```note
When you run tests, coverage will be generated automatically too.
```

`npm test`

### Watch mode

Watch mode allows to run tests as you make changes to project files

`npm test -w`

## 🔭 Linting

`npm run lint`

### Pre-commit hooks

There is a pre-commit hook (setup in the `setup.sh` file) that will lint and unit test the code. To skip this for incremental commits, use:<br>
`git commit [arguments] --no-verify`

### Updating snapshots

The test command is written to update snapshots automatically

`npm test`
